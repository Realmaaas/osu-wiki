During the Finals round, six teams competed for a place among the final three. All had their sights set on the revered podium, but as is the nature of the competition, not all of them could reach it. Read on to find out how each team fought to keep their CWC dream alive, ending in newfound hope for some, and crushed dreams for others.

The No Mod 1s have often been mentioned in these mappool recaps, as a good indicator of the round's overall difficulty. Going much above last week's 8 stars is something we never really saw in the tournament's history, so it was quite the surprise when the first map to be revealed would be [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284)'s [Afflict (feat. Risa Yuzuki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398958#fruits/5199148), with a star rating of 9.46, something we never saw before — save for last year's Grand Finals Tiebreaker, [Frost Walker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202823#fruits/4662299), which ironically had the same star rating.

With the picks becoming increasingly specialized in their respective skills, several maps proved to be a challenge for everyone, such as [Amputee Gerbera](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2399031#fruits/5199361) (DT4), mapped by [Jack Frost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6492475). Pushing the limits of Double Time control and filled with inconsistent spacings and uncomfortable patterns at a high circle size, not a single player broke the 900k score barrier on it — a first for this CWC.

Coming right off of last week's [osu! originals](/wiki/osu!_originals), two of their artists were back in this mappool with some of their older works. [Marmalade butcher](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/220)'s [SYAKUNETSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398973#fruits/5199190) (NM4) would be the convert pick of the week, originally mapped by [FlyingTuna](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9224078), and ramping up the difficulty on the already established formula of a jump-tech-speed hybrid. Same for [Ice](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/484) who just became a [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) last week, being featured in the mappool once again with [Parodia Sonatina Var.II](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398909#fruits/5199074) (DT3) mapped by [Yoshi_green](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1035891), a dense but rather comfortable stream map.

Finally, an already existing and community favourite map in [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284)'s [conflict](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398941#fruits/5199115) (MM2) would appear once again, edited to be fitting for a Finals mappool as an anti-mod Mixed Mod pick. Despite the apparent straight-forward nature of the map, the circle size of 5 and approach rate of 8.2 turned it into a fierce challenge for the players who had to play it on Hidden or Hard Rock.

This pool once again featured an [osu! original](/wiki/osu!_originals), making it the fourth week in a row to have one!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2025-07-19-osucatch-world-cup-2025-finals-recap/petitponey_banner.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398893#fruits/5199031)

Well-known within the osu! community for their eccentric breakcore tracks, [Ruby My Dear](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/370) would make their first osu! original for this mappool, with [Petit Poney](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398893#fruits/5199031). Mapped by [skill issue lol](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12498861) as the Hard Rock 1 pick, it features many of the classic Ruby My Dear breaks and style switch-ups — all reflected within the map, resulting in a consistency test filled with tricky flows and abrupt accelerations. The poney might not be so small after all...

## Semifinals summary

| Team A |  |  | Team B |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| Italy ::{ flag=IT }:: | -1 | **0** | ::{ flag=CL }:: **Chile** |
| **Finland** ::{ flag=FI }:: | **7** | 1 | ::{ flag=FR }:: France |
| **Finland** ::{ flag=FI }:: | **7** | 5 | ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile |
| United States ::{ flag=US }:: | 4 | **7** | ::{ flag=AR }:: **Argentina** |

Unfortunately this round, Italy had to forfeit their losers' bracket match against Chile, resulting in their elimination. Three teams would be left to try and qualify for the next round through that bracket, namely Finland, France, and Chile. France would also end up eliminated in their first match of the week against Finland, leaving Finland and Chile to face off for a spot in the podium, with both teams looking to make history.

On the winners' bracket was one of the most anticipated matches of the tournament, with the two clear favourites playing for a guaranteed spot in the Grand Finals — the number one and two seeds, the United States and Argentina. Let's take a look at how these two matches went!

## Match highlights

### ::{ flag=FI }:: Finland vs. ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile

The losers' bracket final would see Finland (#6) facing off against Chile (#9). In the past few years, neither of these two teams have managed to break into the top three.Chile's last appearance on the podium was in 2019, and Finland has never reached past a top 4 dating back to 2013. For these two teams, this was the opportunity to prove their worth — this year, Chile lost several key players, and many doubted their ability to reach the later stages of the tournament after seeing their qualifiers performance. As for Finland, concerns about their ability to scale and play endgame pools were raised, which was what led to their eliminaton in this very round last year.

Coming into this match, it was very difficult to give an edge to either of the teams. Throughout the tournament, Chile focused on the Double Time, Mixed Mod and Hidden brackets, while Finland opted for the more gimmicky picks, as well as the Mixed Mod and control Double Time picks. Chile was favoured on maps such as [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398898#fruits/5199042), which was promptly banned by Finland, who themselves saw their strongest weapon, [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398883#fruits/5199003), banned by Chile. Most maps left would be very contested either way, and the teams knew it.

Chile looked comfortable at the start of the match, with back-to-back picks won by more than 100k points, in [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398887#fruits/5199012) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398909#fruits/5199074). On the other side, Finland didn't look as good — after a [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398973#fruits/5199190) pick won by barely more than 2k points, they would end up losing on [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398941#fruits/5199115), and conceding a break point.

They were quick to get back on their feet though, taking Chile's [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2399039#fruits/5199376), followed by [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2399031#fruits/5199360) to get back to an even scoreline. The next couple of picks would be quite chaotic — Chile would once again concede a break point, this time on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398903#fruits/5199063), by only 611. But Finland failed to capitalize on it by also losing their own [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398885#fruits/5199008) pick.

Seeing as things could swing either way depending on their performance at the moment, picking proved to be a difficult task for both of the teams. But Chile's [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398907#fruits/5199071) and Finland's [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398958#fruits/5199148) would go to their respective teams, leaving the score at 5—5. However, Chile's next [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398911#fruits/5199078) pick would be their biggest mistake this tournament, letting Finland get a break point, allowing them to close out the match 7—5 on [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398918#fruits/5199091) by only 575 points.

Finland had done it, this year was the one they would finally achieve a podium finish in CWC. Had a couple of close picks gone slightly differently, Chile could have made it, but not this time. Now having to play in the losers' bracket final, Finland's biggest challenge is ahead of them. They are the clear underdogs in the final three, but they also have nothing to lose. Tune in to their match this week to see what will happen next!

There it was, the duel of titans. To anyone following the osu!catch scene, it was no surprise to see the winners' bracket opposing the United States (#1) and Argentina (#2). After last year, a newfound rivalry formed between these Grand Finalists. The United States won 7—4, coming off of the winners' bracket, and ending the tournament without a single match lost, while Argentina themselves had only lost to the United States prior to the Grand Finals. This year however, Argentina had only gotten stronger and were looking to get their revenge.

Argentina would be the first to pick, with a dominant performance on [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398903#fruits/5199063). The United States followed up with [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2399190#fruits/5199818), and also won comfortably. However, Argentina had the edge on the Hidden picks, so the United States would have to properly navigate their pick strategy to match them. The second picks worked out for both teams, being [NM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398885#fruits/5199008) for Argentina, with ::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283) SS'ing it, and [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2399039#fruits/5199376) thanks to a No Mod SS from ::{ flag=US }:: [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006).

The United States would be the first to get a break point on [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398883#fruits/5199003) with a strong 2 miss run from ::{ flag=US }:: [Dahcreeper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6926006), but Argentina would fire right back at them by taking their [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398973#fruits/5199190) pick, thanks to ::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283)'s 2 miss score. With a high potential to perform at any given time, both teams could realistically win their opponent's picks, and we were starting to see it. 

Argentina opted for [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398911#fruits/5199078) and won, but the [DT1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398898#fruits/5199042) pick from the United States would not end up working out, as ::{ flag=AR }:: [Naarkz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19490380) would manage to secure an FC to carry his team to another break point. But that break point would be matched by the United States, taking [HR3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398918#fruits/5199091).

But on their own picks, the United States could not manage to find the right answer against their opponent, who would end up taking [MM2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398941#fruits/5199115) to put them on match point. And despite a good fight from the United States, Argentina would close out the match 7—4 on [HD1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2398887#fruits/5199012).

This was it, Argentina had managed to qualify for the Grand Finals through the winners' bracket for the first time in CWC history, and guaranteed a top 2 finish. For the United States, this was also their first loss in two years, and they would have to face Finland to meet Argentina again.

---

Only three teams remain in this CWC, and they will be competing this weekend during the Grand Finals to decide who will be crowned the 2025 osu!catch World Cup champions. As usual, all the information you may need can be found on the [CWC wiki page](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2025), and the matches will happen on [osulive](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive) and [osulive_2](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive_2).

See you there!
